The problem statement is named Assignment5.pdf <br /><br />

Solution-<br />
-Implemented Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect communities using Apache Spark map reduce
framework.<br />
-Implemented the mathematical estimation of change in graph-modularity with each edge removal
without repeated calculations.<br />
-Used adjacency-lists to represent and access the graph data efficiently.
